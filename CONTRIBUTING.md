# Welcome!
Hi! Clover is a bot that was made for all of usto enjoy, so feel free to contribute to it by making/solving an issue, adding a new feature or a suggestion, or even by pointing out any issues or bugs that you may find. If you're new to programming or to Java, or you can't understand some part of the code, etc., feel free to message me on Discord (`Gartham#7960`) or make an issue asking for help! It gets a bit boring working alone so I'll be glad that you asked. c:

## Contributing
To make contributions, you can ask me to add you as a contributor to the repository in GitHub or you can simply fork the project and contribute to it directly. It's up to you! Feel free to do whatever ye feel is best to contribute, and anything you add I'll go over and consider. Even if it's just adding comments to a file (we actually really need these haha), and even if they're *wrong*, don't feel shy to submit a pull request. I'll look over everything and be happy to fix any bugs or misteaks you make.

## Help
If you need help with GitHub, the bot, or your math homework, hit me up on Discord, or make an issue in the repository asking for help (if you need that). There are plans to add really really speedy and short YouTube vids to help you understand how to work GitHub, how to set up your IDE, etc. etc. etc. if you've never coded or used GitHub before in your life. That said, whenever I'm not doing homework of my own, I'll reply ASAP. If I am doing homework, I'll just reply right after.

## Copyright
If you're here, it's probably because you want to help out, in which case I can't thank you enough, but to be able to do things like run the bot, it's a requirement that the copyright of any applicable contributions you make are transferred over to me. This allows me to do simple things, such as run the bot, which can contain code you've made, but it can also allow me to do things like make the project open source later, perhaps if enough people request it. This does NOT mean that you can't get recognition for your contributions (GitHub matches contributing accounts to commits by email address). You are still the one who made the contributions you make.
