# Welcome!
Hi! Clover is a bot that was made for all of usto enjoy, so feel free to contribute to it by making/solving an issue, adding a new feature or a suggestion, or even by pointing out any issues or bugs that you may find. If you're new to programming or to Java, or you can't understand some part of the code, etc., feel free to message me on Discord (`Gartham#7960`) or make an issue asking for help! It gets a bit boring working alone so I'll be glad that you asked. c:

## Contributing
To make contributions, you can ask me to add you as a contributor to the repository in GitHub or you can simply fork the project and contribute to it directly. It's up to you! Feel free to do whatever you feel is best to contribute, and anything you add I'll go over and consider. Even if it's just adding comments to a file (we actually really need these haha), and even if they're *wrong*, don't feel shy to submit a pull request. I'll look over everything and be happy to fix any bugs or misteaks you make. :-)

## Help
If you need help with GitHub, the bot, or your math homework, hit me up on Discord, or make an issue in the repository asking for help (if you need that). There are plans to add really really speedy and short YouTube vids to help you understand how to work GitHub, how to set up your IDE, etc. etc. etc. if you've never coded or used GitHub before in your life. That said, whenever I'm not doing homework of my own, I'll reply ASAP. If I am doing homework, I'll just reply right after.

## Legal Stuff
If you're here, it's probably because you want to help out, in which case I can't thank you enough, but to be able to do things like run the bot, it's a requirement that the copyright, claims of ownership, and all rights of any contributions you make are transferred over to me, (Gartham). This allows me to do simple things, including but not limited to, run the bot, which may contain code you've made, but it can also allow me to do things like make the project open source later, perhaps if enough people request it.

By making a contribution, you forfeit any claims of ownership and all rights of any contributions you make, including but not limited to copyright claims and rights, to me, (Gartham), to the fullest extent allowed by law. If needed to effect such, your contributing, by your own will, shall constitute an electronic signature to these written provisions, or any portion of these provisions that require such.

You are under no obligation to contribute, and all contributions should be by your own will. Additionally, please do not contribute material that you do not have the rights to, as you need to be able to follow the above conditions in your contributing. If you do not have the ability (either due to law(s) you're subject to, lack of ownership, etc.) to agree to the aforementioned provisions for contribution, don't contribute it.

That said, I care about your desires regarding your works. If you have *any* problems or concerns with how the content you make will be used or is being used, please let me know. If you want something you've contributed to be removed, modified, or otherwise, chances are that I'll do so or will initiate an effort to do so, so please don't feel threatened or shy away from bringing to me your concerns.
